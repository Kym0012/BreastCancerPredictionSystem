# Breast Cancer Prediction System
This system is designed to predict breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes data on various attributes of breast cancer tumors to classify them as malignant or benign.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this system is stored in breast-cancer.csv. It contains the following attributes:

id: ID number of the patient
diagnosis: Diagnosis of the tumor (M = malignant, B = benign)
Various features describing characteristics of the tumor cells.
## Getting Started
To run the prediction system, follow these steps:

## Install the required Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kym0012/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb:

Copy code
jupyter notebook breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Models Used
The system utilizes the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Accuracy Score
## Results
After training and testing the models, the system outputs predictions for the test dataset and compares them with the actual labels.
